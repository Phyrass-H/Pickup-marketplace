## 2026-06-16 — Session 1 — Project bootstrap & env setup
**Branch:** `claude/compassionate-tesla-rdbmqb`

**What happened**
- Read all spec docs (00–05), the Phase 0 Data Spine, and `pickup_schema.sql`.
- Agreed the first milestone: a single end-to-end Driver PWA vertical slice
  (auth → Pool → detail → accept → My Rides). Plan approved in principle; build deferred
  until the user says go.
- Set up the environment (no app code yet, per user request):
  - `.gitignore`, `.env.local` (real keys, git-ignored), `.env.example` (placeholders).
  - `CLAUDE.md` with persistent rules + glossary.
  - `project/` continuity docs (STATUS, SESSION_LOG, DECISIONS, IDEAS).

**Decisions** — see `DECISIONS.md` (D1–D5).

**State of the DB:** empty. First session of PickUp; nothing exists yet.

**Next session:** when user says go — scaffold the Next.js PWA and build the Driver slice
(see `STATUS.md` → Next up).
