## 2026-06-25 — Session 18 — Fix: "Review" silently posted the mission (React node-reuse) + irreversible-post guardrails
**Branch:** `main` (working tree — **not yet committed/deployed**, awaiting founder review) · **Env:** local → Vercel.

**Why:** founder report — on `/dispatch/new`, clicking **"Review mission →"** posted the mission LIVE and jumped to the
Schedule (no review step, no explicit confirm); separately, "Post to the Pool" sometimes "did nothing". Item **#5**
of the founder's 2026-06-25 dump. Founder also asked: keep "Post to the Pool" but add an **irreversible** warning.

**Root cause (reproduced + verified in-browser, not guessed):** the edit-mode **Review** button (`type=button`) and the
preview-mode **Post to the Pool** button (`type=submit`, `intent=pooled`) render in the SAME position inside
`.mx-actions`, so React **reused the same `<button>` DOM node** and patched its `type` to `submit` *during* the click
that flips to preview → the browser then submitted the form = a LIVE post. Proven with a capture-phase submit
interceptor: clicking Review fired a `submit` whose `submitter` was the "Post to the Pool" button. **Ruled out** a
service worker (there is none — verified) and the Enter key (never pressed).

**What shipped (`mission-form.tsx` + `dispatch/new/actions.ts`, no schema change):**
- **Node-reuse cure** — distinct React `key`s on the edit vs preview `.mx-actions` containers, so React MOUNTS A FRESH
  button set instead of re-typing the Review node in place. Review now ONLY previews (verified: **0 submits**).
- **Server safety net** (`createMission`) — `intent` no longer defaults to `"pooled"`. A submit carrying neither
  `"pooled"` nor `"draft"` (e.g. a stray implicit submit) now redirects back to the form **writing NOTHING** — it can
  never silently post a live mission. (Defence in depth.)
- **Enter-key guard** — broadened: a stray Enter inside any single-line `<input>` is blocked in BOTH edit AND preview
  (was edit-only); `<textarea>` (newlines) and `<button>` (keyboard activation) left untouched.
- **Irreversible warning** (founder ask; D25 preview-approved) — amber `.notice warn` at the confirm step:
  "This is final. Posting sends the mission live to the Driver Pool right away — it can't be un-posted. Use Edit or
  Save as draft if you're not ready." The **"Post to the Pool"** label is kept.

**Verified** — `tsc` clean (didn't run `next build` while the dev server was live). Browser (real Supabase,
Business dev-login): Review → preview with **0 submits** + warning renders with the exact wording; "Post to the Pool"
fires `intent=pooled`, "Save as draft" fires `intent=draft`; **real end-to-end draft create → `/dispatch/drafts` →
discard** (zero residue); no console errors; screenshot matches the approved mockup.

**Also fixed (pre-existing, surfaced during #5):** the preview card showed a bogus "~4907 km" when **no dropoff** was
picked — `review()` used `Number(fd.get("dropoff_lat"))`, and `Number("")` is `0` (a "finite" coordinate), so it
computed a pickup→(0,0) great-circle distance. Switched to the file's existing `toNum` helper (empty → null, matching
the server action's `num`). Verified: no-dropoff shows no distance; a real dropoff still shows the right figure
(Nice → Cannes "30 km · 39 min").

**Follow-up (same session) — double-submit duplicates + discard confirmation (founder retest):**
Founder hit **duplicate missions**: a Céline Yow trip posted **7×** (DB: 7 inserts in 14s, 1–4s apart) + a twin
draft. Root cause: the form had **no in-flight guard**, so repeated clicks during the slow server action each
inserted a row (the #5 fix stopped accidental Review-posts, not deliberate re-clicks on a slow Post/Save).
- **Fix (`mission-form.tsx`):** a pending-aware `SubmitButton` via `useFormStatus` — while `createMission` runs
  EVERY submit button is **disabled** and shows "Posting…/Saving…". Verified live: mid-flight the button was
  `disabled=true`, `aria-busy=true`, label "Saving…". A second click now hits a dead button → no duplicate.
- **Discard confirmation (founder ask; `components/draft-actions.tsx`, new):** discarding a draft now needs an
  **inline confirm** ("Discard this draft? This can't be undone." + Cancel + red Discard), also pending-guarded.
  `drafts/page.tsx` now renders `<DraftActions>` instead of the bare discard form. Verified end-to-end (confirm
  shows, Cancel reverts, Discard deletes), `tsc` clean, no console errors. **Visual follow-up:** the draft card's
  "Continue editing" button was squeezed — `.btn` defaults to `width:100%`, so once Discard left its `<form>`
  wrapper it fought the flex layout; pinned Discard to content width (`flex:none; width:auto`). Verified
  (Continue 423px / Discard 93px, balanced).
- **Slowness (founder Q):** it's `npm run dev` (dev-mode compilation) + Supabase/Mapbox network round-trips before
  the redirect — NOT hardware; production is faster. No code change. (Optional future: move the Mapbox ETA call off
  the critical post path.)
- **Duplicate cleanup:** removed my own throwaway test drafts via the UI. The founder's **7 duplicate Céline Yow
  pooled missions** (17:00 UTC / 19:00 Paris, ceiling 170) + 1 stray Céline draft REMAIN — handed the founder a
  scoped `delete` SQL for the Supabase SQL editor (Claude does not delete shared-DB rows without authorization;
  the auto-mode classifier correctly blocked an attempt).

**Quick-polish batch (same session, shipping items as completed):**
- ✅ **Keyboard nav in the address autocomplete** (`components/address-autocomplete.tsx`): the Mapbox suggestion
  dropdown is now a proper ARIA combobox — **↑/↓** move the highlight (wrap-around, `aria-selected` +
  `aria-activedescendant`, scroll-into-view), **Enter** selects the highlighted suggestion (retrieves coords,
  closes the list, does NOT submit the form), **Esc** closes. `.ac-item.is-active` mirrors the hover style.
  Verified live (arrows move the highlight, Enter picked Nice with coords 43.71/7.26, Esc closes, no console errors).
- ✅ **Draft indicator in the sidebar** (`dispatch-shell.tsx` + `(dispatch)/layout.tsx` + `dispatch/new/actions.ts`):
  the **Drafts** nav item shows a navy count badge when drafts exist (a small dot when the sidebar is collapsed).
  Count is fetched in the layout (`count: "exact", head: true`) and kept **fresh** after save/post/discard via
  `revalidatePath("/dispatch", "layout")` in `createMission` + `discardDraft` (the layout otherwise persists across
  client nav and would go stale). Verified live: badge matched the DB (1), **1→2 on save**, **2→1 on discard**,
  collapsed-mode dot OK, no console errors. (Dev preview got flaky mid-verification — restarted the dev server for a
  clean run; confirmed read-only via service role that no stray test drafts were left.)

- ✅ **Driver search in the Calendar** (`components/dispatch-calendar.tsx`): the existing guest search now ALSO
  matches the **assigned driver's name** — the `match` filter ORs `e.driver` alongside `e.guest` (`CalEntry.driver`
  was already populated by the server). Placeholder/aria-label → "Search guest or driver…". Verified live:
  "Marc"/"Dubois" → 7 driver-matched trips (no guest carries those), "Willis" → 1 (guest search intact),
  nonsense → 0; no console errors.
- ⚠️ **Deploy ops gotcha (2026-06-25):** Vercel's GitHub auto-deploy **silently dropped** commit `1bc8671` — it
  created NO deployment for it, so the live calendar kept showing the OLD guest-only search even though the code was
  correct and `next build` passed locally. The founder reported "search doesn't work" twice; root cause was the
  missing deploy, not the code. Fix: pushed an **empty re-trigger commit** (`git commit --allow-empty`, `4c34c6c`) —
  Vercel picked that one up and deployed `success`. **Lesson:** after `git push origin main`, verify a deployment was
  actually created — `gh api repos/Phyrass-H/Pickup-marketplace/deployments --jq '.[0].sha'` should equal the pushed
  SHA. If a push is dropped, push an empty commit to re-trigger (or Vercel dashboard → Redeploy). The GitHub
  deployments `?sha=` filter needs the FULL 40-char SHA; the short SHA returns empty.

- ✅ **#6 Desktop width** (`dispatch-shell.tsx` + `globals.css`): `.dx-main` was capped at **1120px + left-aligned**,
  leaving dead space on wide monitors (324px at a 1680px viewport — "squished to the left"). Added a
  **`.dx-main--wide`** modifier (max-width **1520px**) that the shell applies on the **dense data views only**
  (Schedule / Calendar / History) via `pathname`. The **new-mission form is deliberately left UNTOUCHED** (founder
  asked) — it keeps the 1120px default (form grid 1072px, identical to before); Drafts (560px cards) + Settings also
  unchanged. D25 loop: showed before/after at 1680px (live CSS injection, nothing committed); founder approved
  widening the dense views but explicitly NOT the mission page. Verified live: Schedule/Calendar/History fill (1444px,
  0 dead space), new-mission still 1120/1072, Drafts still 560; tsc clean, no console errors.

**Next:** **#7 sidebar spacing** (last visual quick-polish, D25 preview loop). Bigger form work after:
reference/comment split, a Driver section [language/dress code/message-to-driver], ultra-luxury tier.

## 2026-06-24 — Session 17 — Named passengers (first + surname, capacity-capped) + idea-dump filed
**Branch:** `main` (committed + deployed) · **Env:** local → Vercel. **Migration:** founder-applied
`docs/migrations/2026-06-23_named_passengers.sql` (additive `mission.passenger_names jsonb`).

**Why:** founder ask — let the Dispatcher name **multiple Guests** (First name + Surname) on a mission, **capped
by the vehicle** (Sedan 4 / Van 7). Designed via the D25 preview loop (mockups → founder chose: rows = headcount,
structured storage, Sedan 4 / Van 7, prominent Add button).

**What shipped:**
- **`components/passenger-list.tsx`** (new): rows of `{first,last}`, "Add passenger", **capped by Body type**
  (`seatCap`: Sedan 4 / Van 7 / Any 7, nudge past 4). Rows = headcount; names optional; remove disabled at 1,
  add disabled at cap; emits a hidden `passenger_names` JSON field. **`lib/passengers.ts`** (new): shared
  `Passenger` type, `seatCap`, `parsePassengers`, `primaryPassengerName`, `splitFullName` (DRY across the
  component, the preview and the server action).
- **Cross-card cap sync:** `ServiceClassFields` gained an `onBodyChange` callback; `MissionForm` lifts the body
  value and passes it to `PassengerList`, so the cap reacts to the Vehicle & class selection.
- **Form rewire** (`mission-form.tsx`): replaced the "Passengers" number input + the single "Guest name" text
  input with `<PassengerList>`; `review()` derives guest + pax from the named list. **Action** (`actions.ts`):
  writes `passenger_names` (jsonb) + the denormalised `passenger_name` (first NAMED Guest) + `pax_count`
  (= rows). **Types:** `mission.passenger_names: Json|null`.
- **Migration:** additive `passenger_names jsonb`, **applied by the founder** in the Supabase SQL editor —
  schema rule #4: I can't run DDL with the app keys (PostgREST does rows, not table structure), only the founder
  via the dashboard.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` green. Browser (real DB): add/remove rows; **cap reacts to Body** (Sedan→4,
Van→7) cross-card; **save-as-draft writes `passenger_names`** → **resume reads the names back** (Jean Dupont +
Marie Martin, tier/body/cap restored); preview shows "Jean Dupont · 2 pax"; **posted live → schedule shows the
Guest**; no console errors. (Dev preview got flaky mid-session from a build/dev `.next` clash — fixed by
`rm -rf .next` + clean restart; the ChunkLoadError was env, not code.)

**Reviewed** — 19-agent adversarial workflow (4 dims → 2-skeptic verify); 15 raw → **5 confirmed, all fixed:**
(MED) legacy/pre-migration drafts carried their count only in the old number field → resume now **pads rows up to
`pax_count`** so the count survives a resume+save; (MED) an untouched form stored a junk `[{"",""}]` blob → now
stores **null** when no Guest is named (count preserved in `pax_count`); (LOW) the cap warning was mounted fresh
so screen readers missed it → **always-mounted `role=status` live region**; (LOW) `.pl-note` text failed WCAG AA
at 12px → darkened to `#854f0b` (~6.5:1). `tsc`+build green after; live-region fix confirmed in-browser.
Decision kept (founder's model): rows = headcount, so an untouched mission reads "1 pax" by design.

**Also filed earlier this span (committed `0f346ee`):** founder idea-dump → **BACKLOG § L** (guided-form polish:
input-driven hints, why/how microcopy, smart most-used defaults, saved base addresses, multiple passengers ✅
this session, dress code) + **IDEAS "Founder idea dump — 2026-06-23"** (V2/strategic: Bus tier, First/VIP van,
cargo vehicle, driver specialisation, pricing engine, driver-vetting toggle, anti-disintermediation, overtime,
At-Disposal UX). Also: **specific-car dropdown** restyled (`appearance:none` + custom chevron, S16 follow-up,
committed `a7618a1`).

**Next:** deployed. The **BACKLOG § L** guided-form polish items are the obvious follow-on (founder priority:
features/polish before APIs/integrations).

## 2026-06-22 — Session 16 — Service-class redesign: tier tiles + tidied specific-car
**Branch:** `main` (committed `6c0a326`, **pushed + deployed**) · **Env:** local → Vercel. **Design loop:** D25.

**Why:** founder feedback — the **"Service class (routes to the matching Pool)"** control in the Vehicle &
class card was a native `<select>` sitting right above the modern segmented Body-type control, so it read as
outdated. Also flagged a real dead control: **Eco + a body** showed a single-option dropdown ("Any eco Sedan
(recommended)") because the catalog has **no Eco models**.

**Design loop (D25):** Claude-Code inline HTML mockups from the real navy tokens → founder compared
segmented-vs-tiles → chose the **richer tier tiles**; asked to keep the specific-car **a simple dropdown** (no
opt-in/search) and approved **hiding it for Eco**. Iterated the mock to the final before any code.

**What shipped (`components/service-class-fields.tsx` + additive CSS in `app/globals.css`):**
- **Service class → three selectable tiles** (Eco / Business / First), each with a short example (Eco:
  "Standard comfort"; Business: "Mercedes E, BMW 5, Audi A6"; First: "S-Class, 7 Series, Maybach"). Replaces
  the native `<select>`; a **hidden `<input name="category">`** carries the tier so the submit contract is
  unchanged. Selected = navy border + `--accent-soft` fill.
- **Body type → full-width** segmented control (`.seg--full`; `.seg`/`.seg-btn` themselves untouched).
- **Specific car → still a dropdown** for Business/First, but **hidden for Eco** (no catalog models) — a
  one-line `.tier-empty` note replaces the dead single-option dropdown. Gate:
  `showCarPicker = body && (carsFor(tier,body).length>0 || specific)`. Default helper vs the "fewer matches"
  warning when a model is picked. Removed the now-redundant per-body `carRangeHint` line.
- New additive CSS: `.tier-tiles`/`.tier-tile`(`.is-on`,`:focus-visible`), `.seg--full`, `.scf-label`,
  `.tier-empty`. **No schema, no token change**, no other component touched.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` green (25 routes). Browser (real DB, Business dev-login): tiles render +
select (old `<select name=category>` gone); clicking a tier updates the hidden `category`; full-width body seg;
Business+Sedan → dropdown (40 opts) + default helper; picking Classe E → `required_make=Mercedes-Benz` /
`required_model=Classe E` + "fewer matches" warning; **Eco → picker hidden + note**, make/model cleared;
no console errors. All four form fields submit exactly as before.

**Reviewed** — 12-agent adversarial workflow (4 dims → 2-skeptic verify); 8 raw → **1 confirmed (MED)**: the
**selected** tile's example text (`--text-muted` on `--accent-soft`) was **4.05:1**, below WCAG AA. **Fixed** —
recoloured `.tier-tile__eg` to `--slate-600` (~6.5:1 on the tinted tile, ~7.6:1 on white); re-verified the
computed colour in-browser (`rgb(71,85,105)`).

**Next:** deployed; founder review. Driver-app layout redesign + small navy polish items still open.

---

## 2026-06-21 — Session 15 — New-mission Pricing card + read-only Summary rail
**Branch:** `main` (working tree, **uncommitted** — awaiting founder review/deploy) · **Env:** local → Vercel.

**Why:** founder feedback on the S14 two-pane form — the **Ceiling** input lived in the right-hand Summary
rail, split from the **Estimated base fare** (which sat in Trip details). The founder's point: the rail should
be a **read-only preview**, not an input section; group the two fare inputs together.

**Design loop (D25):** Claude-Code inline HTML mockup from the real navy tokens first → founder reacted
("the new pricing card is nice, I like it") and asked why the *rest* looked different (answer: the mockup is a
hand-built replica, the real app was untouched) → confirmed via Q&A: a **new dedicated Pricing card**, **SPEED
WIN moves with it**, **actions stay in the rail**, and the **card header matches the others** (no navy tint) →
implemented for real.

**What shipped (`app/(dispatch)/dispatch/new/mission-form.tsx` only — no other file, no schema, no token change):**
- **New "Pricing" section card** (5th, left pane) grouping the three existing pricing inputs:
  **Estimated base fare** (moved out of Trip details), **Ceiling** (moved out of the rail), **SPEED WIN**
  (moved out of the rail) — plus the too-low warning + a one-line helper. Same `.mx-card__*` slate icon chip
  + uppercase title as the other four cards (Lucide `Wallet` icon).
- **Summary rail is now read-only** — **0 input fields**. Shows the Ceiling as a value, the live starting fare
  (`.mx-fare`), and a **"Pricing mode"** line (SPEED WIN badge / "Standard climb"), then the actions
  (Review / Save draft / Post). Empty-state when no ceiling yet. The `createMission` contract is unchanged
  (same field `name`s submit from the relocated inputs); the D22 draft/Review flow + live ETA + waypoints all
  preserved. Reference textarea in Trip details nudged to `marginBottom:0` (cosmetic, now last field there).

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` green (25 routes). Browser (real Supabase, Business dev-login): 5 cards
incl. Pricing; exactly one ceiling/base/speed_win input each (no duplicates); rail has **0 inputs**; live fare
120 → **60,00 €** standard / **84,00 €** SPEED WIN; too-low warning fires (base 140 > ceiling 120) inside the
Pricing card; responsive collapse <900px intact (`position:static`, single column); no console errors.

**Reviewed** — 18-agent adversarial workflow (4 dims → 2-skeptic verify); 14 raw findings → **1 confirmed
(LOW)**: the too-low warning was **hidden in preview** mode (it had moved into the `display:none` `.mx-sections`).
**Fixed** — a compact version now renders in the read-only rail **only in preview** (`tooLow && mode==="preview"`)
so there's no edit-mode duplication and the post-time nudge is restored. Re-verified in-browser (edit: warning
in the card only; preview: "Below the recommended base fare — may go unfulfilled." in the rail).

**Next:** founder review → push `main` to deploy when okayed. **Not deployed.** Optional follow-up still open:
the Driver-app layout redesign + the small navy polish items (green "Complete ride", logo re-export).

---

## 2026-06-21 — Session 14 — Mission-page redesign: app-wide navy + two-pane new-mission form (Direction B)
**Branch:** `session-14-mission-redesign-navy` (off `main`, merged + deployed) · **Env:** local → Vercel.
**Decisions:** D24 (navy + two-pane), D25 (design = Claude-Code inline HTML mockups).

**Why:** the founder wants the **new-mission page** (`/dispatch/new`) to breathe — clear sectioning, less
narrow, a more "serious/solid/confident" look, away from the bright "Facebook" blue.

**Design loop (D25):** instead of Claude Design zips, this session used **Claude-Code-authored HTML mockups
rendered inline** (the visualize widget) from the real tokens + data → founder reacted in plain language →
iterated (two layout directions; cool vs warm; **four navy depths** → locked **#25344C**, between ink and
navy; fixed a `+`-marker alignment bug live in the mock) → then implemented for real.

**What shipped:**
- **App-wide navy palette** (token layer, `app/globals.css`): action blue → **navy #25344C** (`--blue-*`,
  `--ring`); status **"info"** (Confirmed/Accepted) → **steel #1b5e8a** (mirrored in `lib/dispatch-status.ts`)
  so it stays distinct from the navy CTA; hardcoded blues fixed (`.badge.status`, `.notice.info`, date-picker
  focus). Brand logo gradient untouched (logo-only).
- **`/dispatch/new` → Direction B two-pane** (`mission-form.tsx`, `page.tsx`): ONE `<form>`; left = 4 section
  cards (Vehicle/Route/Schedule/Trip) with slate icon chips + uppercase titles; right = a **sticky navy
  Summary rail** — mini-route, live **ETA** (mirrors the route card), Ceiling, a **live starting fare**
  (re-prices on ceiling/SPEED-WIN change), SPEED WIN toggle, actions. Collapses to 1 column <900px. The D22
  draft/Review flow + live ETA + waypoints all preserved. `RouteStops` publishes a snapshot via
  `onSummaryChange` + accepts `etaDefault` (no behavioural change to its inputs).

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` green. Browser (real DB, 1320px + mobile): two-pane render, rail ETA ==
route-card ETA, live fare 120→60€ / SPEED WIN→84€, Review preview fare agrees, responsive collapse, **Driver
app** navy OK (Accept reads primary, logo intact). Deploy **confirmed live** (CSS bundle hash changed; has
`.mx-summary` + `#25344c`).

**Reviewed** — planning workflow (3 agents: palette audit + form architecture + risks) front-loaded the
change; 4-dim adversarial review (16 agents) → 5 LOW findings **all fixed** (draft-ETA seeding + loading
state, aria-live on the fare, heading semantics, empty-state contrast); **final post-deploy 3-angle agent
check (11 agents) = ALL CLEAR (0 confirmed).**

**Follow-ups (optional, noted not done):** Driver "Complete ride" could be intentionally green (the
`success-btn` class falls through to navy `.btn`); re-export the logo to harmonise its sky-blue with navy;
the Dispatch sidebar doesn't auto-collapse on a phone (pre-existing; Dispatch is desktop-first).

---

## 2026-06-20 — Session 13 — Route card redesign: stop autocomplete + live ETA + France-biased geocoding
**Branch:** `session-13-route-eta-geocoding` (off `main`, not yet merged/deployed) · **Env:** local → Vercel.

**Why:** founder feedback on the new-mission route block (4 asks). Item 5 (the full **mission-page**
redesign — breathing, card separation, light colours) is the agreed **next** chunk, after these land.

**What shipped (this branch):**
- **Stops are now geocoded** (`components/route-stops.tsx`): each stop is a Mapbox `AddressAutocomplete`
  (was a plain text box), so a stop carries coords. Written to the hidden `waypoints` field as JSON
  `[{address,lat,lng}]`; parsed by a **shared** `parseWaypointsField` (`lib/waypoints.ts`) used by both the
  server action and the client preview (legacy newline fallback) so they can't drift.
- **Route card redesign:** the floating blue **+** next to "From" is gone — replaced by an **"Add a stop"**
  row in the rail; the stop marker is the **red square** from the founder's reference (`route-ic--stop`);
  more padding + soft shadow so the card breathes (`app/globals.css`).
- **Live distance + travel time** while picking addresses (like any ride app): `AddressAutocomplete` got an
  `onChange` that lifts the picked place; `RouteStops` fetches `POST /api/eta` (new route) → `routeMetrics`,
  debounced/aborted, shown as "27 km · 37 min" (·​ "via N stops" when routed through stops). Traffic-aware
  (`depart_at` = the chosen pickup time). The same value feeds the **preview card** (road ETA, hidden
  `route_distance_km/min`) and is recomputed authoritatively at posting (now **through the stops** — closes
  the D23 multi-stop-ETA follow-up).
- **France-biased autocomplete** (`components/address-autocomplete.tsx`): added a **`country` allowlist**
  (`fr,mc,it,ch,de,es,be,lu,nl,gb,at,pt`) to the Search Box suggest call → no more USA/Canada junk, while
  Cannes→Geneva/Berlin/Milano still resolve; dropoff/stops bias `proximity` to the picked pickup.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` clean. Browser (real Supabase, Business dev-login): POI search returns
**France-only** results ("Aéroport Nice" → correct airport; pickup-proximity confirmed on the dropoff
suggest URL); live ETA "27 km · 37 min" appears on pickup+dropoff pick; adding an **Antibes** stop re-routes
to "28 km · 1 h 04 · via 1 stop" and stores `waypoints` with coords; the **preview card** shows the stop as
a proper leg (Cannes → Antibes → Nice) + road ETA — not raw JSON.

**Reviewed** — ran a 37-agent adversarial workflow (5 dimensions, 2-skeptic verify). 7 confirmed, **all
fixed:** (HIGH ×3, same bug) the preview `review()` still split the now-JSON `waypoints` by newline → showed
the raw JSON blob (and `[]` for 0-stop missions) — fixed via the shared `parseWaypointsField`; (HIGH) the
`driving-traffic` 3-coord cap was stale (real limit 25) so 2+ stops silently lost traffic + `depart_at` —
raised to 25; (LOW) an aborted ETA run's `finally` could clear the loading flag a newer run owns — guarded
on `signal.aborted`; (LOW) the live ETA line wasn't announced to screen readers — `role="status"
aria-live="polite"`; (MED) `/api/eta` didn't bound the points array — cap 25. `tsc`+`build` green after.

**Note:** running `npm run build` while the `next dev` preview server is live corrupts `.next` (500s) —
restart the dev server after a build, or don't build while it's running.

**Next:** founder review → deploy this branch; then **item 5 — the mission-page redesign** (HTML-mockup loop).

## 2026-06-19 — Session 12 — Mission-form pickers, then O5 vehicle taxonomy + real ETA
**Branches:** `session-11b-pickers-stops` (date/time + stops — merged + deployed) ·
`session-12-vehicle-taxonomy-eta` (O5 + ETA — to deploy). **Env:** local → Vercel. **Decisions:** D23.

**Form polish (deployed earlier this session):**
- Removed the nonsensical time chips; new **separate date picker** (calendar popover, past days disabled)
  + **time picker** (15-min quick list + exact entry) — `components/date-time-picker.tsx`.
- Replaced the comment-like stops textarea with a **route block**: From → stops → Where to, **+** to add /
  **×** to remove (`components/route-stops.tsx`), per the founder's screenshot. Verified + live.

**O5 vehicle taxonomy + real ETA (D23):**
- Founder applied the additive migration (`docs/migrations/2026-06-19_vehicle_taxonomy_and_eta.sql`):
  `body_type` enum, `vehicle.body_type`, `mission.required_body_type/required_make/required_model/
  distance_km/duration_min`; legacy `van` category → business+van.
- **Tier × body** model + a **car catalog/classifier** (`lib/vehicle-catalog.ts`, founder's data): a
  two-step fallback `categorize(make,model)` (checked-brands + premium-model exceptions, else Eco)
  **auto-classifies** a Driver's tier — they don't self-select. Tiers display **Eco · Business · First**.
  Dispatcher picker (`components/service-class-fields.tsx`): tier + Any/Sedan/Van + hint + optional specific
  car; Driver fields (`components/driver-vehicle-fields.tsx`) show the auto-detected tier + body. Alias-aware
  matching (verified: Classe S→First, X5 40d→Business, Classe A→Eco, A3→Eco, Renault→Eco).
- **ETA** via Mapbox Directions (`lib/directions.ts`), cached; shown as "27 km · 40 min" on Pool card /
  Dispatch row / detail (straight-line `~` fallback). **Traffic-aware** — `driving-traffic` + `depart_at`=
  pickup time, so the ETA varies by day/hour (verified 37 min Mon 9am vs 31 min Sun 2pm, same 27 km route;
  founder confirmed Mapbox-only, no Google). Pool matches tier + body + specific car.
- **Adversarial review** (16 agents) found 7 issues; **6 fixed**: numeric-as-string render crash on
  sub-10km trips (formatKm coerce), body picker tri-state (Any → null, no longer hides van drivers),
  tolerant specific-car match (Mercedes≈Mercedes-Benz via `carMatches`), drop legacy `van` from write
  allowlists, conditional ETA write (no wipe on transient routing failure), synthetic specific-car option.
  Deferred (LOW): ETA ignores un-geocoded stops; bind Driver car to catalog for fully-robust specific match.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` green throughout. Browser (real DB): pickers, add/remove stop,
service-class picker reactivity, ETA "27 km · 40 min" on a created mission, Business·Van excluded from a
Business·Sedan driver's Pool, Any-body default. Unit-tested `carMatches` + `formatKm` string-coercion.
**Next:** deploy `session-12`; founder owns the Driver-app redesign.

## 2026-06-19 — Session 11 — Founder brain-dump triage → quick wins + post-flow
**Branch:** `session-11-quickwins-postflow` (off `main`, not yet merged/deployed) · **Env:** local → Vercel.

**Why:** the founder dumped 18 unorganised observations. We triaged them (grounded by a 5-reader
workflow over docs/schema/code/legal/project) into NOW / decision / schema-change / future / legal,
then the founder chose to **(a) ship the quick wins, (b) lock the post-flow, (c) record the triage**.
Full triage lives in **BACKLOG § K**; the two decisions are **D21** (SPEED WIN) + **D22** (post-flow).

**What shipped (this branch):**
- **O10 / D21** — SPEED WIN now starts at **70%** of the ceiling and climbs +5% every 5 min (was flat
  100%). `lib/pdp.ts` short-circuit removed; `dispatch/new/actions.ts` sets the curve. No schema change.
- **O11 + O15 / D22** — new-mission **preview card** before posting + **save-as-draft / resume / discard**
  (`/dispatch/drafts`, new sidebar entry). Resume = in-place UPDATE (user session); discard = service role
  (no DELETE RLS). Drafts excluded from Schedule/Calendar/History.
- **O9** — pickup time is **Europe/Paris** explicit → real UTC instant (`lib/time.ts`), past-time guard,
  quick chips (In 1h / Tomorrow 08:00 / 18:00) + live Paris echo. Fixes the old server-local-zone bug.
- **O1** — trip **distance** (straight-line) on Driver Pool card, Dispatch row + detail, mission detail,
  and the preview. **O3** — stops ("+N stops") now on the Driver Pool **card** (`lib/waypoints.ts` DRY).
- **O6** — Driver car **make/colour/plate** captured at onboarding + shown on the **Dispatch** trip row
  for the assigned Driver (vehicle joined on schedule/history).
- **O13 + O17** — Settings (both apps) link **Terms / Privacy / Support / Share feedback**; bilingual
  **FR+EN** `/legal/terms` + `/legal/privacy` (⚠️ placeholder copy — must be lawyer-drafted).

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` clean (now 25 routes incl. `/dispatch/drafts`, `/legal/*`).
Browser-tested against the real Supabase DB (seeded): Mapbox-geocoded new mission → Review preview
(60€ = 50% start, ~19 km, stop shown) → Save draft → Drafts page → resume (all fields prefilled, "Editing
a saved draft") → toggle SPEED WIN (preview 84€ = 70%) → Post = in-place update, draft list empties,
mission on schedule (climbed 84→90€). Pool cards show `~km` + `+1 stop`; accepted a mission → Dispatch row
shows **Car: Mercedes Classe E · Noir · AB-123-CD**. No console errors.

**Reviewed** — ran a 12-agent adversarial review workflow over the diff; **4 confirmed, all fixed:**
(1) **HIGH** — posting a *saved* draft to the Pool left the PDP climb origin (`created_at`) in the past,
so a stale draft would post already near/at the ceiling → now the resume UPDATE resets `created_at` to
now when going live (not on re-save). (2) `parisLocalToUtc` accepted out-of-range parts (month 13, day 99…)
and silently rolled them over → added an overflow/round-trip guard returning null (unit-tested, DST-correct).
(3) the resume UPDATE reported success even on 0 rows matched (stale tab / double-submit) → now `.select("id")`
+ a "draft already posted/discarded" message. (4) dev `/api/seed` SPEED WIN mission still used the old
flat-at-ceiling PDP → updated to the D21 70% curve. `tsc` + `next build` green after fixes.

**Next:** ⚠️ before prod, real legal copy for `/legal/*`; a real `support@` mailbox. Then the schema-change
items (O2 guest phone, O5 vehicle taxonomy, O7 cancellation — last one is lawyer-gated). Branch is **not
deployed** — merge/push `main` when the founder okays.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Session 10 — Dispatch redesign (Claude Design handoff, pass 2)
**Branch:** `main` (committed + deployed) · **Env:** local (macOS) → Vercel.

**Why:** the founder designed in **Claude Design** and exported a handoff bundle
(`PickUp Design System-handoff.zip`). The Claude Design connector (`DesignSync`) is blocked in
this session (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN can't get design scopes; `/login` unavailable — confirms
D19), so the **zip → unzip → implement** path was used. Bundle kept locally at `.design-handoff/`
(gitignored, reference for the Driver phase). Scope confirmed up front: **adopt Geist + Lucide**,
**flight column = number + ETA (no live status)**, **full calendar upgrade**.

**What shipped (Dispatch / Business only):**
- **Foundation** — full design-token set in `app/globals.css` (slate + action-blue, the five
  status tones, spacing/radii/shadows/focus-ring); **Geist + Geist Mono** via `next/font` (`geist`
  pkg, self-hosted, GDPR-safe); **lucide-react**. Buttons/inputs/cards gained focus rings + press states.
- **Sidebar shell** (`components/dispatch-shell.tsx`) — collapsible sidebar (66px icon rail, persisted
  to `localStorage`) + sticky topbar title, replacing the top tabs. Deleted `dispatch-header.tsx` +
  `dispatch-tabs.tsx`.
- **Schedule** (`trip-row.tsx` + `page.tsx`/`history`) — 6-col grid with a **Flight** column (number +
  ETA), tone left-edge + status pills, **T-180 red row-wash** for unconfirmed-near-pickup.
- **Calendar** (`components/dispatch-calendar.tsx` + server `calendar/page.tsx`) — month **+ week**
  views, **KPI filter chips**, guest search, status/vehicle filters, **day peek drawer**, cross-month
  week navigation (`?week=first|last`), and **＋/empty-day → New mission prefilled with that date**.
- **Glossary fix:** schedule/history header is **"Guest / ref"** (never "client").
- **Dev-only:** `/api/seed` now also creates the dispatcher `profile` row (no schema change) so
  `dev-login` lands in a populated Dispatch — made verification possible + eases future local testing.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` clean (13 routes). Browser-tested against the real Supabase DB
(seeded Business): shell + collapse, schedule + flight chips + day groups, calendar month/week/peek,
KPI counts (6/0/1), new-mission date prefill, settings; **Driver app unaffected** (shares `globals.css`).
Ran a **16-finding adversarial review workflow** (20 agents); **11 confirmed, all fixed + re-verified**
(week cross-month nav, drawer Escape/focus/scroll-lock, calendar keyboard a11y, dialog/filter accessible
names, "Confirmed" KPI count, "Today" history push, footer month, **glossary "Guest/ref"**, flight ETA).
**Live on `dispatch.pickupbedriven.com`** (curl: new tokens + `.dx-sidebar` + Geist @font-face present,
old `.tabs` gone).

**Decisions:** D20 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Next session:** the **Driver app** as a pixel-perfect phone mockup (the `ui_kits/driver/` kit in the
bundle), then apply it. Plus pending: Mapbox token URL-restriction (BACKLOG H), per-role PWA.

**Addendum (2026-06-19):** Confirmed the design loop — **Claude Design → Export zip → drop in session →
implement → deploy** — as the standing workflow (connector blocked, zip is reliable; see D19/D20). Clarified
how new design elements map to backend: visual/layout → just build; new UI over existing data/actions →
wire it (e.g. the calendar's "New mission" reuses `createMission`, filters run client-side); anything
needing new backend/schema/external service → flag a **"needs a backend decision"** list and confirm first
(never fake it). What this pass actually wired beyond visuals: calendar **New-mission date prefill**
(`?date=` → existing insert), calendar **data layer** (server builds entries incl. driver-name reveal +
month meta for the client component), **cross-month week nav** (`?week=` param), flight column reads existing
`flight_number`/`flight_eta` (display only), and `/api/seed` creating the dispatcher `profile`. Founder asked
for a candid codebase health check — verdict: clean foundations + unusually strong docs (a takeover team
orients fast), but it's an MVP: the gaps are **tests, CI, generated types, real auth, monitoring** — now
captured in **BACKLOG H2 (Engineering hardening)**; founder intent is to do them all before production.
Refreshed `NEXT_SESSION.md` to this state. No code changes in the addendum.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Session 9 — Custom domain + subdomain role routing
**Branch:** `subdomain-routing` (off `main`, merged + deployed) · **Env:** local (macOS) → Vercel.

**Why:** founder hit "role switching" — one browser shares a single Supabase session cookie on
`pickup-marketplace.vercel.app`, so signing in as the other demo role (Driver ↔ Business) overwrote
it and open tabs flipped roles on refresh. Root cause = one host = one cookie slot (NOT the long URL).

**What shipped**
- **Domain:** founder bought **`pickupbedriven.com`** (OVH) and pointed two CNAMEs at Vercel —
  **`driver.pickupbedriven.com`** + **`dispatch.pickupbedriven.com`** (both green, SSL auto-issued).
  Vercel shows "DNS Change Recommended" (cosmetic — CNAMEs resolve to Vercel; works).
- **Subdomain role routing** (`lib/hosts.ts`): on the prod domain the Driver app lives on `driver.*`
  and the Business/Dispatch app on `dispatch.*`. `app/page.tsx` + the `(app)` and `(dispatch)`
  layouts route a user to their role's subdomain (wrong role → their area; right role/wrong subdomain
  → their host). Dev-login buttons now target each role's OWN subdomain so the host-only session
  cookie lands on the correct host. **No-op off the prod domain** — localhost + `*.vercel.app` keep
  single-origin path-based routing.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` clean; local prod build probed with spoofed Host headers (unauth
stays on each host's /login; localhost unchanged); 9/9 host→role unit cases. **Live on the real domain
(curl):** Driver → `driver.*/pool` (200); Business → `dispatch.*/dispatch` (200); **the driver's
cookie does NOT carry to `dispatch.*`** (→ /login) — the two sessions are isolated, switching is gone.

**Decisions:** D18 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Deferred/flagged:** real magic-link across subdomains (host-only cookies mean a user must sign in on
the right subdomain — fine for per-subdomain dev-login; revisit for real email, BACKLOG A); the bare
root `pickupbedriven.com` still points to OVH parking (decide destination); Mapbox token
URL-restriction now unblocked (BACKLOG H); per-role PWA manifest/icons; Supabase redirect URLs to add
before real email.

**Next session:** design pass, the remaining domain polish (root destination + Mapbox restriction +
per-role PWA), or detail/behavior fixes.

**Addendum (same session, 2026-06-18):** Shipped several things on top of the subdomains, all on `main`
(Claude Code can now push `main` for deploys — founder added an `autoMode.allow` rule in
`.claude/settings.local.json` after the harness blocked direct pushes to the default branch):
- **Root splash** — `pickupbedriven.com` / `www` now show a small "Driver / Business" chooser
  (`components/landing-splash.tsx`, rendered by `app/page.tsx` only on the bare prod host). DNS: apex +
  `www` A-records → Vercel `76.76.21.21`; **www-canonical** (apex 308-redirects to www, which serves the
  splash). Verified live.
- **Design pass 1 (Business)** — `app/globals.css` refreshed to a clean, conventional **blue/slate**
  theme (action blue `#2563EB`); **white app header + brand logo** (`public/logo.png`) replacing the navy
  bar; blue buttons; logo on login + splash. Login is **host/side-aware** (`dispatch.*` → "PickUp
  Dispatch", `driver.*` → "PickUp Driver"; was hardcoded "PickUp Driver" on both). Fixed the logo aspect
  ratio (tall 924×1153 pin; was squished to a square). Verified live on both subdomains.
- **Mapbox token URL-restriction** — still deferred (BACKLOG H); fine for closed beta.
- **Claude Design loop** — added `project/DESIGN_BRIEF.md`. Feed Claude Design via its **"Create here →
  Connect to GitHub"** path (repo is public) — NOT `/design-sync` (that's for packaged design-system
  libraries / Storybook; PickUp is a Next.js app, and DesignSync needs a `/login` re-auth). Round-trip:
  design in Claude Design → **Export → "Send to local coding agent"** → Claude Code implements + deploys.
  See D19.

**Still next:** receive the first Claude Design handoff (Business), then the **Driver app as a
pixel-perfect phone mockup**; later the Mapbox restriction + per-role PWA + detail/behavior fixes.

## 2026-06-17 — Session 8 — Driver service area (base + radius) + avatar crop
**Branch:** `driver-service-area` (off `main`) · **Env:** local (macOS).

**Why:** founder feedback — a fixed town checklist doesn't model real VTC work. A Cannes Driver
will take Milan→Nice (ends near home) but not Paris→Normandie. Need a base + radius, not a town list.

**What shipped**
- **Service-area matching (replaces zones):** Driver sets a **base** (Mapbox autocomplete) + a
  **service radius**; the Pool now keeps a mission when its **pickup OR drop-off** is within the
  radius of the base (`lib/geo.ts` haversine; `app/(app)/pool/page.tsx`). New
  `components/address-autocomplete.tsx` (Mapbox Geocoding v6, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`). Driver
  settings + onboarding capture base + radius; Business booking form geocodes pickup/drop-off into
  `mission.pickup_lat/lng` + `dropoff_lat/lng`; `zone` is now a display label from the pickup town.
- **Avatar/logo:** `components/avatar-editor.tsx` (react-easy-crop crop + zoom + remove, immediate)
  on both Driver photo and Business logo; `lib/avatar-actions.ts` (gated to the caller's own row).
- **DB:** additive migration `docs/migrations/2026-06-17_driver_service_area.sql` (founder-approved,
  ran in SQL Editor) adds `driver.base_label/base_lat/base_lng/service_radius_km`. Deleted the
  orphaned `lib/zones.ts`.

**Handoffs done by founder:** Mapbox public token (added to `.env.local`; **still needs adding to
Vercel env before deploy**) + ran the additive migration.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` clean. Browser (real Supabase, both roles): Mapbox autocomplete
live (suggestions→pick→coords), base/radius save+persist, Pool radius UI; matching math proven
(Milan→Nice in / Paris→Rouen out). Caught + fixed an **infinite-render loop** in the autocomplete
(array-literal prop in effect deps). Ran a **13-finding adversarial review workflow** (24 agents)
and fixed: seed missions now carry coords (else invisible in the new Pool), server-side avatar
content-type validation, pickup-coords + lat/lng-range guards, autocomplete request-abort, avatar
object-URL leak + modal Escape/scroll-lock/aria, radius-option preservation, canonical docs
(Doc 00 + Phase0 spine) updated. Deferred only the cosmetic zone-label refinement (#5).

**Decisions:** D17 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Next session:** apply the Mapbox token in Vercel + verify live; optionally improve the derived
zone label (town from Mapbox context); then Payments (Stripe Connect) or the admin verification
workspace (BACKLOG F2).

**Addendum (same day):** deployed S8 to `main`; verified the Mapbox token is compiled into the live
build (autocomplete works live). Token URL-restriction deferred until a final domain exists (tracked
in BACKLOG H). **Bugfix (branch `fix-poi-autocomplete`):** the booking autocomplete used the
**Geocoding API**, which has no points of interest → French hotel/airport names returned foreign
junk ("Hôtel Negresco" → California; "Aéroport Nice" → Brazil). Switched to the **Mapbox Search Box
API** (suggest → retrieve, session-token based) — returns POIs. Verified live in-browser
("Aéroport Nice" → correct airport, coords 43.6597/7.2058) and cross-border (Milano) intact; `tsc` +
build clean. Component contract unchanged (same hidden lat/lng fields), so no page edits needed.

---

## 2026-06-17 — Session 7 — Accounts & records pillar
**Branch:** `accounts-records` (off `main`) · **Env:** local (macOS).

**What shipped** — the records layer both sides need before real onboarding/payments. All
**KEEP**, existing tables, **no schema change**. Files (proofs/images) go to **Supabase Storage**,
buckets created on demand via the service-role Storage API (operational setup, not a DB migration).
- **Storage foundation** (`lib/supabase/storage.ts`): `ensureBucket` (idempotent), `uploadFile`,
  `signedDocUrl` (private), `publicMediaUrl` (public). Two buckets: **`documents`** (private —
  signed URLs) and **`avatars`** (public — logo/photo). `lib/account.ts` = doc-type lists + labels.
- **Driver `/settings`**: edit name, phone, languages, GPS, zones, **profile photo**, + **vehicle**
  (make/model/colour/plate/seats/category). **Business `/dispatch/settings`**: name, field, **logo**,
  Dispatcher contact. Writes via service role gated to the caller's own row (D6/D7 pattern).
- **Documents** both sides (`components/document-section.tsx` + `lib/document-actions.ts`): one
  upload row per type → private bucket + `document` row, status stays `pending` (👤 verify). Status
  pill + signed "View" link. Driver: licence/VTC/REVTC/insurance/RC Pro/carte grise. Business: Kbis.
- **Bank/payouts = honest stub**: Driver "Payouts" + Business "Billing" cards show connected-state
  from `stripe_account_id`/`stripe_customer_id`; inert "coming soon" CTA. **No raw IBAN/card capture**
  (no columns; PCI) — Stripe Connect is a later pillar.
- **Mission history**: Driver `/rides/history` (month-grouped past completed/cancelled rides) +
  Business `/dispatch/history` (month-grouped past trips, reuses `TripRow`). Nav: Settings in the
  Driver header; History + Settings tabs in Dispatch; logo shown in the Dispatch header.
- Also (founder request): added an **"Internal tooling & observability stack"** pillar to
  `BACKLOG.md` (F2) — product analytics / Sentry / session replay / admin back-office + GDPR.

**Verified** — `tsc` + `next build` clean (19 routes). Browser-tested via preview against the
**real Supabase DB** (dev-login both roles): Driver settings render + edit-save persists; the
private-docs path proven end-to-end (bucket auto-provisioned, upload, `document` row `pending`,
signed URL HTTP 200) and renders "Pending review" + working View link; Business settings + Kbis
row + disabled Billing CTA; **logo** path proven (public bucket, header shows it); both history
views show real past missions grouped by "juin 2026". Fixed a polish bug: archived history rows no
longer show the live "pickup soon — call them" alarm (`missionTone(..., {archived})`). 1×1 test
artifacts cleaned up afterward; the two buckets remain (ready infra).

**Decisions:** D16 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Deferred/flagged:** file-pick can't be driven in the headless preview, so the upload UI itself
wasn't clicked through a real file — the storage mechanism was proven server-side instead (mirrors
the action exactly). History "fare" shows the PDP value (no stored final fare until the ledger is
written). Real email auth + Stripe wiring remain separate pillars.

**Next session:** Payments (Stripe Connect — turns the bank stubs real + writes the ledger/voucher),
or real email auth (flip dev-login off), or the observability/admin pillar (BACKLOG F2).

---

## 2026-06-16 — Session 6 — Live deploy + full backlog & next-session plan
**Branch:** `main` (consolidated). **Live:** https://pickup-marketplace.vercel.app

**What happened**
- **Merged everything to `main`** (founder authorized) and **deployed to Vercel**. Verified live:
  `/login` 200, dev sign-in blocked without key (403) and works with key (307 + session).
- Added **key-gated dev sign-in** so the founder can test the live site solo with no email /
  Supabase config: `/dev-login?key=<DEV_LOGIN_KEY>` (set in Vercel env). Local stays open.
- Founder is testing live and happy. Going forward: build on a branch, merge to `main` to deploy.
- **Planned the rest of the product**: wrote `project/BACKLOG.md` (full feature list tagged
  KEEP/MANUAL/V2 against Doc 02) and `project/NEXT_SESSION.md` (ready-to-paste prompt).

**Key facts for next time**
- Deploy = push to `main` → Vercel auto-redeploys (~1 min). Vercel env has the 3 Supabase keys
  + `DEV_LOGIN_KEY=v1a-DbkJHN9Dw3aqWKDGSfZ9`.
- Most remaining KEEP work needs **no schema change** — `document`, `payment`,
  `ledger_transaction`, `payout`, `booking_voucher`, `status_event` tables already exist.
- Before real beta: switch on email magic-link (one Supabase redirect-URL setting) and turn
  off dev-login.

**Decisions:** D15 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Next session:** recommended pillar = **Accounts & records** (profiles/settings, vehicle details,
document uploads → Storage, bank details, mission history). See `project/NEXT_SESSION.md`.

---

## 2026-06-16 — Session 5 — Dispatch redesign: booking-style schedule + calendar
**Branch:** `claude/compassionate-tesla-rdbmqb` · **Env:** local (macOS).

**Why:** founder wants the Business side to feel like hotel booking / fleet-dispatch software —
dense lines (not big cards), status visible at a glance for 10–55 trips/day, plus a calendar.

**What shipped** (replaces the card list on `/dispatch`):
- **Schedule** (`/dispatch`): dense rows grouped by day, **Today pinned** on top, past under an
  "Earlier" fold. Columns: Time · Route · Client/ref · Driver · Status. Each row has a
  **colour-coded left edge + status pill** (`lib/dispatch-status.ts` `missionTone`): green =
  in progress, blue = confirmed/accepted, amber `!` = unfilled & pickup soon, **red `!` = accepted
  but not confirmed near pickup ("call the driver")**, grey = pooled. Click a row → **expands in
  place** (native `<details>`) with full route, live progress, fare, guest, pax/luggage, flight,
  and the Driver's tap-to-call number. Auto-refreshes (LiveRefresh).
- **Calendar** (`/dispatch/calendar`): month grid (Mon-start, prev/next), trips placed on their
  day with colour dots + time + place, today highlighted.
- **Flexible reference field**: the booking form's notes field is now "Room / event / reference",
  shown as a chip on each line — works for hotel room **or** event name. Stored in the existing
  `comment` column (no schema change).
- Tabs (`DispatchTabs`) for Schedule / Calendar / New; header simplified to brand + business + sign-out.

**Verified in a real browser:** schedule with Today/▾Earlier grouping, coloured pills incl.
`!Unfilled`, reference chip, row-expand detail with driver phone; calendar month with placed,
colour-coded trips and Prev/Next. `tsc` + `next build` clean.

**Decisions:** D14 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Deferred/flagged:** reference lives in `comment` for now (promote to a dedicated column later);
fully user-configurable columns not built (single reference covers the 90% case); calendar entries
are display-only (no click-through to a filtered day yet); design/skin still to come (founder will
hand a design).

**Next session:** apply the founder's design when provided, or click-through from calendar day →
schedule, or payments / booking voucher.

---

## 2026-06-16 — Session 4 — Realtime status feed (trip execution)
**Branch:** `claude/compassionate-tesla-rdbmqb` · **Env:** local (macOS).

**What shipped** — the last functional piece of the core loop: the Driver runs the trip and the
Business watches it live.
- **Driver status buttons** (My Rides): for a confirmed mission, a single "next step" button
  advances en_route → arrived → on_board → completed (`lib/mission-flow.ts`, `StatusControl`).
  Each tap records a **status_event** AND moves `mission.status`. A 4-step progress bar
  (`StatusSteps`) shows where the trip is.
- **Status write path** (`app/(app)/rides/actions.ts`): a Driver can't UPDATE `mission` via RLS
  (no driver update policy), so after verifying ownership + valid transition under RLS, the
  status_event insert + mission update go through the **service role**.
- **Business live view**: `/dispatch` shows each active mission's progress bar + status badge and
  **auto-refreshes every 4s** (`LiveRefresh`) so Driver updates appear within seconds.

**Verified in a real browser (preview):** as the demo Driver, tapped "Start — I'm en route" → DB
shows `mission.status=en_route` + a `status_event`; switched to the demo Business and `/dispatch`
showed that mission **En route** with the progress bar advanced and the Driver's contact. `tsc` +
`next build` clean (12 routes).

**Decisions:** D13 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Deferred/flagged:** near-realtime is **polling** (4s), not websockets — true Supabase Realtime
needs `status_event` (and/or `mission`) added to the `supabase_realtime` publication (a one-time
DB enable; not done, to respect "don't touch the schema"). `completed` currently just sets the
status — the payment capture + ledger + booking-voucher on completion are a later milestone.

**Next session:** the **design layer** (one pass over both apps; needs a colour/logo direction
from the founder), or payments (Stripe Connect) / booking voucher.

---

## 2026-06-16 — Session 3 — Dispatcher (Business) slice — the loop closes
**Branch:** `claude/compassionate-tesla-rdbmqb` · **Env:** local (macOS).

**What shipped** — the other half of the marketplace, so the core V1 loop is now real
end-to-end (no more seed-only missions):
- **Role-aware app** (`lib/app-context.ts` + `routeFor`): one app serves Driver + Business,
  keyed off `profile.role`. New `/welcome` lets a first-time user pick Driver or Business.
- **Business onboarding** (`/onboarding-business`): creates `business` + `dispatcher` seat +
  `profile(role=dispatcher)`.
- **Dispatch area** (`/dispatch`): missions list for the Business, with the **assigned Driver's
  contact revealed** once accepted (service-role-gated to their own missions — mirror of the
  Driver side).
- **Create mission** (`/dispatch/new`): KEEP fields (category→pool routing, zone, addresses,
  intermediate stops, pickup time, pax/luggage, flight, comment, **ceiling**), posts straight
  to the Pool. Live **soft warning** when ceiling < estimated base fare (nudge, not block).
  PDP curve auto-derived; SPEED WIN toggle. Inserted via the **user session** so RLS authorizes
  it (no service role). Maps/geocoding deferred — addresses are free text, lat/lng null.

**Verified — the whole loop, under real RLS (not service-role bypass):** a Node script signed in
as a real Business and a real Driver and proved: Business inserts a mission as itself → Driver
sees it in the Pool → `accept_mission` succeeds (status=accepted, driver set) → **second accept
correctly rejected (atomic first-wins)** → both sides read the assigned mission. Plus `tsc` clean,
`next build` clean (11 routes), all guards redirect correctly.

**Decisions:** D11–D12 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Deferred / flagged:** Maps geocoding + real distance-based base fare; `datetime-local` is parsed
in the server's local zone (make Europe/Paris explicit before prod); Dispatcher realtime status
feed + mission detail/edit; mission can be posted with a past pickup time (no guard yet).

**Next session:** full browser walkthrough of both sides together, then realtime status feed
(Driver 4 status buttons → Dispatcher) or the design layer.

**Addendum (same session):**
- **Zones = whole French Riviera** (Saint-Tropez → Monaco/Menton). Founder confirmed it's the
  whole region, not 3 towns. `lib/zones.ts` now lists the Riviera communes (west→east).
- **One-click dev sign-in** (`/dev-login` + `GET /api/dev-login?as=driver|business`): lets a
  non-technical founder test locally with NO email and NO Supabase dashboard config — ensures a
  confirmed user via the service role and signs in server-side (sets the session cookie).
  Dev-only (blocked on hosted envs). Verified: sets `sb-…-auth-token` and routes to /welcome.
  The Supabase redirect-URL allowlist is still needed for real magic-link sign-in in PRODUCTION.

## 2026-06-16 — Session 2 — Driver PWA vertical slice (the bones)
**Branch:** `claude/compassionate-tesla-rdbmqb` · **Env:** local (macOS), pushes to GitHub.

**What shipped** — the first end-to-end Driver slice, KEEP-only, design deferred:
- Scaffolded Next.js 15.5 (App Router, TS) + Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr`).
  Hand-wrote `lib/database.types.ts` from `pickup_schema.sql` (D3) — never migrated the schema.
- **Auth:** email magic-link (OTP/PKCE) → `/auth/callback` → cookie session via middleware.
  `/login` is a server-guarded wrapper (redirects authed users) around a client form.
- **Onboarding** (glue): minimal Driver profile — zones + one vehicle/category — because the
  Pool can't filter without it. Writes via service role (no INSERT RLS on profile/driver).
- **Pool** (`/pool`): pooled missions filtered by the Driver's `vehicle.category` ∈ +
  `zone ∈ operational_zones`. PDP fare computed on read (`lib/pdp.ts`).
- **Mission detail** → **Accept** = `rpc('accept_mission', { p_mission_id })`, called as the
  user session. All atomic/slot-conflict/Lock-in logic stays in the DB function.
- **My Rides** (`/rides`): assigned missions with **contacts unlocked** — revealed server-side
  via the service-role client, gated to missions owned by this Driver (RLS can't express that).
- **Dev-only seed** (`GET /api/seed`): Business + Dispatcher + 6 pooled missions across zones/categories.

**Verified:** `tsc` clean · `next build` clean · dev server boots · route guards redirect ·
live Supabase read+write (seed inserted 6 missions; Pool filter returns the right 3).

**Review:** ran a 5-lens adversarial workflow (schema/security/auth/spec/correctness). Fixed all
8 confirmed findings: open-redirect in callback `next`, onboarding write-errors swallowed
(redirect-loop risk), seed route hardened to local-only, callback/login now surface link errors,
authed users redirected off `/login`, glossary "Client"→"Passager" in a seed comment, and
documented the Supabase redirect-URL allowlist. Also caught + fixed a PostgREST bulk-insert
NULL gotcha on `speed_win`, and upgraded `@supabase/ssr` 0.5→0.12 (see D10).

**Decisions:** D6–D10 (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Action needed from the founder before the slice runs end-to-end in a browser:**
1. Supabase → Auth → URL Configuration → add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to Redirect URLs.
2. Confirm the **third beta zone** (placeholder `Antibes` in `lib/zones.ts`).

**Next session:** manual browser run-through (login→onboarding→pool→accept→rides); then either
add realtime to the Pool, PWA icons + offline, or start the Dispatcher mission-creation side.

**Repo layout:** spec docs moved root → `docs/` as their single home (founder's preference;
files were byte-identical, nothing lost). `CLAUDE.md` references updated to `docs/…`.

## 2026-06-16 — Session 1 — Project bootstrap & env setup
**Branch:** `claude/compassionate-tesla-rdbmqb`

**What happened**
- Read all spec docs (00–05), the Phase 0 Data Spine, and `pickup_schema.sql`.
- Agreed the first milestone: a single end-to-end Driver PWA vertical slice
  (auth → Pool → detail → accept → My Rides). Plan approved in principle; build deferred
  until the user says go.
- Set up the environment (no app code yet, per user request):
  - `.gitignore`, `.env.local` (real keys, git-ignored), `.env.example` (placeholders).
  - `CLAUDE.md` with persistent rules + glossary.
  - `project/` continuity docs (STATUS, SESSION_LOG, DECISIONS, IDEAS).

**Decisions** — see `DECISIONS.md` (D1–D5).

**State of the DB:** empty. First session of PickUp; nothing exists yet.

**Next session:** when user says go — scaffold the Next.js PWA and build the Driver slice
(see `STATUS.md` → Next up).
