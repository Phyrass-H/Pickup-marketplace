# PickUp — Ideas & Parked Notes

> Loose ideas, "remember to consider", and things that aren't yet in the spec docs.
> When an idea becomes a real plan, promote it into the spec docs (00–05) or DECISIONS.md
> and remove it here. Keep this from becoming a second source of truth.

## Build-time reminders
- Enforce the glossary in code: name variables/components Business/Dispatcher/Driver/
  Guest/Pool/Ceiling — never `client`/`principal`. Consider a lint note in review.
- PDP fare is computed on read — keep a single shared `pdp.ts` so Driver + Dispatch agree.
- Pool RLS lets a Driver read *any* pooled mission; the zone/category narrowing is done in
  the query, not by RLS. Keep that filter in one place to avoid drift.

## Parked (not yet scoped)
- Seed/fixtures script for local testing (Driver + Vehicle + sample pooled missions).
- Scheduled jobs the spine assumes (PDP climb, Lock-in/T-180, expiry, return-to-pool) —
  not in the first slice; plan where they run (Supabase cron / edge functions / Vercel cron).
- TypeScript type generation via Supabase CLI once credentials/CLI are wired (see D3).

## Questions to raise with the user when relevant
- Beta zones: Doc 00 says Cannes, Nice + one more — confirm the third town for seed data.
- Preferred GPS deep-link behaviour (waze/google/apple) — confirm per-platform URLs later.
