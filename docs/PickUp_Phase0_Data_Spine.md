# Phase 0 — PickUp · Data Spine

> Scope: the single structural reference for the build — entities, fields, enums, relationships, and the mission state machine. Everything in the Driver PWA and Dispatch dashboard maps back to this.
> **Last updated:** this session — folded in cancellation model, group hook, mission_type hook, flight_eta, and the Lock-in rule.
> Terminology per Doc 00: Business · Dispatcher · Driver · Guest · Pool · PDP · Ceiling · SPEED WIN. Never "client" / "principal".

## Entities (12)

**Business** — the company posting missions (hotel, agency, concierge).
`id · name · field_of_activity · logo_url? · stripe_customer_id? · created_at`

**Dispatcher** — a user/seat at a Business. (Multi-seat is V2; V1 = one seat works.)
`id · business_id→Business · auth_user_id→Auth · name · email · phone · created_at`

**Driver** — the professional VTC who accepts and performs missions.
`id · auth_user_id→Auth · first_name · last_name · phone · email · profile_photo_url? · languages[] · operational_zones[] (legacy — superseded by base+radius, 2026-06-17) · base_label? · base_lat? · base_lng? · service_radius_km (default 50) · preferred_gps (waze|google|apple) · stripe_account_id?

**Auth/Role** — Supabase Auth. Links to a Driver or Dispatcher.
`auth_user_id · role (driver|dispatcher|admin)`

## Enums

- **role** — driver · dispatcher · admin
- **vehicle_category** — eco · business · van · luxury
- **mission_type** — transfer · hourly        *(hourly = at-disposal / mise à disposition; V2 feature, enum present now as a hook)*
- **mission_status** — draft · pooled · accepted · confirmed · en_route · arrived · on_board · completed · cancelled · expired
- **cancellation_party** — driver · business · system
- **document_type** — drivers_licence · vtc_card · revtc · insurance · rc_pro · vehicle_registration · company_registration
- **document_status** — pending · verified · rejected
- **payment_status** — requires_capture · captured · refunded · failed

## Mission state machine (the spine)

```
draft ──post──▶ pooled
pooled ──accept (atomic, first wins)──▶ accepted          // removed from Pool, contacts unlock
pooled ──hits pickup deadline / unfilled──▶ expired
pooled ──business cancel──▶ cancelled                     // terminal, Business compensation (MANUAL in beta)

// LOCK-IN RULE — keyed to time-to-pickup, not the urgency flag:
accepted (pickup ≥3h away) ──Lock-in confirmed at T-180──▶ confirmed
accepted (pickup ≥3h away) ──Lock-in NOT confirmed──▶ pooled    // driver_id cleared, returns to Pool
accepted (pickup <3h away) ──auto──▶ confirmed            // no Lock-in needed; accept = confirmed

confirmed → en_route → arrived → on_board → completed     // each step = a StatusEvent

{accepted|confirmed} ──driver cancel──▶ pooled            // re-pooled for another Driver; cancelled_by=driver, cancelled_at set → penalty (MANUAL in beta)
{accepted|confirmed} ──business cancel──▶ cancelled        // terminal; cancelled_by=business → compensation (MANUAL in beta)

completed ──▶ Payment captured + LedgerTransaction + BookingVoucher
```

**Rules that protect the loop**
- **Accept is atomic.** Two Drivers tapping at once → exactly one wins; the other sees "already taken." (Conditional update on `status='pooled'`.)
- **Slot-conflict check** at accept: a Driver can't hold two overlapping missions.
- **Lock-in** is the readiness confirmation (the old "T-180"): required only when pickup is ≥3h away; under 3h, accepting *is* the confirmation.
- A **driver cancel re-pools** the mission and stamps `cancelled_by/cancelled_at` so a penalty can be applied; a **business cancel is terminal**. Penalty/compensation amounts are MANUAL in beta.
- Time-based transitions (PDP climb, Lock-in, expiry, return-to-pool) are driven by **scheduled jobs**, not user actions.

## Computed, not stored

- **Current PDP fare** = `f(base_fare, ceiling, time_to_mission, pdp_start, pdp_step, pdp_interval)` — deterministic, recomputed on read. SPEED WIN starts at/near ceiling. Never persisted as the "price."
- **Pool** is a *query/view*, not a table. Matching is by distance from the Driver's base (replaced the zone-list model 2026-06-17; see DECISIONS D17):
  `missions WHERE status='pooled' AND category = driver.vehicle.category AND (haversine(base, pickup) ≤ service_radius_km OR haversine(base, dropoff) ≤ service_radius_km)`.
  Mission `pickup_lat/lng` + `dropoff_lat/lng` are geocoded (Mapbox) at posting time; the filter currently runs in the app (beta scale).

## V1 boundaries (so the model doesn't grow legs)

- One Vehicle per Driver · single missions only (no grouped/recurring) · `mission_type` always `transfer` in V1 · no wallet/periodic billing · no in-app chat (reveal phone on accept) · no live-map GPS (status feed only) · no ratings · no substitute-driver swap.
- **Hooks present but inert in V1** (cheap now, avoid a live-table migration later): `group_id`, `mission_type=hourly`.

**Open decisions feeding this model** (don't block the schema — they're values, not structure):
- Commission split numbers (teaser: ~12.5% Business / ~10% Driver).
- Commission carved-out vs added-on **[legal]**.
- Charge timing — auth-at-booking vs capture-at-completion **[legal]**.
- Cancellation %s — Business compensation tiers + Driver penalty cap **[legal]**.
- Hard floor field — pending the floor-vs-benchmark decision.
- Fare extras (waiting time, tolls, airport fee, hourly overtime) — base modelled; extras pending.
- "SPEED WIN" final name (candidates: Rush, Fast Track).
